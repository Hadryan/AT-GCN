Pytorch implementation of the paper : Modeling Label Dependencies for Audio Tagging with Graph Convolutional Network

## To start
```
This code is based on https://github.com/MaigoAkisame/cmu-thesis.
You can run it by replacing the files in https://github.com/MaigoAkisame/cmu-thesis/tree/master/code/audioset by the files we provide.
```

```
Also, you can follow another code https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn.
Simply add the model in net.py to https://github.com/qiuqiangkong/audioset_tagging_cnn/blob/master/pytorch/models.py.
```
